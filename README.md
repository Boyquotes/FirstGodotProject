# FirstProject
My first godot project

---

### What I have done so far: 
- Create a world
- Create a mesh(floor) with a StaticBody(non-moving "hitbox")
- Create a player(bean) with a "hitbox"
- Add a camera, which is the players POV
- Give the player the ability to move(used a template)
- Create a "neck" so the player can look around using the mouse
<br/>
- Followed [this tutorial]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4IEPi1c0eE")

### What I want to do:
- Add a detailed environment
- Give the player an actual character model(no more bean)
- Add something else to do, ex.
    - More rooms
    - Guns
    - Other "player" (cpu)
